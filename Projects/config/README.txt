### IMPORTANT ###:

This folder contains examples configuration files used to access
your Wireless network and your MQTT server.

DON'T ENTER ANY (SENSITIVE) CONFIGURATION DATA INSIDE THIS DIRECTORY!!!

Instead copy the files elsewhere where they are excluded from source control and will not be automatically published on to the internet!
Only add the required configuration parameters in the files at that safe(r) location.

Then adjusts the paths to these files in any source code where relevant.
